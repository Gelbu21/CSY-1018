                    <h6>Experience</h6><br>
                    <p>Ankit Thapa is our professor of computer website design. He is very punctual and a little strict with time which became my main reason to wake up in the morning. He has a convenient way of teaching by mixing both English and Nepali languages when needed.With my interest in the IT sector, the accessibility of the computer and its mechanic is very familiar to me. Starting the undergrad program in Nami, I got an opportunity to learn computer systems, databases, and websites. For this assignment, I will mainly describe my experience of the website sector.</p>
                    <p>Due to the COVID pandemic, the earlier classes were all online. Although the professors were trying their best, it was less comprehensible than physical classes. In the initial stage, I was not used to the codes used in HTML and CSS which then created difficulty for me to grasp the course.Learning the process of making web pages was both fun and strenuous. Therefore, solving even the tiniest part of the error gave me a sense of success. I got familiarized with HTML and CSS and it helped me build my ability to make a fine webpage.</p>

                    <h6>Design</h6>
                    <p>The design decisions in the webpages are made simple and easier for the user to read the content. The colors that are used are aesthetic and comfortable to the eyes making the pages more attractive to the users. The quote at the end of the pages acts as a hook to add more beauty to the pages with a certain sense of motivation. As the responsive part was very hard for my program codes due to which I am unable to make the webpages responsive.</p>

                    <h6>Changes</h6>
                    <p>I was primarily more focused to make my webpages look more colorful. I thought that with more colors, the webpage would look more attractive. But, with my progress in webpages, the webpage look better with simple coloring and design placements. So, i removed the linear gradient background at first and then placed the grid in columns form which became my finalize product.</p>

                    <h6>Module Experience</h6><br>
                    <p>The website course (CSY-1018) is a fun course with the use of different codes and their functions. Learning the code is not that complex whereas the problem I had was with their placements. Overall, this module is exciting as well as tiring.</p>
